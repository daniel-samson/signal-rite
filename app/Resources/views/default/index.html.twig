    <h1>Purpose</h1>
    <p><strong> SignalRite is a small, focused backend service that simulates how healthcare financial systems identify revenue leakage, compliance risk, and billing anomalies using rules-driven analysis and explainable outputs.</strong></p>
    <p>The goal is not to recreate a full billing system, but to demonstrate:</p>

    <ul class="mx-2">
        <li>How healthcare charge data is evaluated</li>
        <li>How rules and compliance logic are applied</li>
        <li>How actionable financial insights are produced</li>
    </ul>
